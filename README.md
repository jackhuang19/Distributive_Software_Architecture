# Distributive_Software_Architecture

Course Overview

  In this class you will learn how to write web-based client/server applications. This will include HTML,
  CSS, JavaScript in the client browser; application programs written in PHP and Python/Django on the
  server side; and an SQL database on the backend.

  For the first part of the course, we will study general concepts in distributed computing and systems,
  and specifically, one example of a distributed system, the World Wide Web (WWW).
  For the second part of the course, we will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop client-side applications.
  Then, we will study PHP running on Apache with MySQL on the back end, using Eclipse (using
  appropriate plugins) as our programming environment.

  For the third part of the course, we will cover database fundamentals and how to setup a database server.
  For the last part of the course, we will cover principle design patterns for web development.
  Along the way (if time permits) we will encounter some of the principles of distributed computing. These
  issues will include distributed programming models, network protocols, multi-threaded programming,
  synchronization, authentication, security, etc.
